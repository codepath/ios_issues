# iOS Issues

This repo is for tracking the progress of our CodePath.org iOS course. Let us know about anythng that seems **outdated or broken** as well as any **additional content** you'd like to see in the course.

When reporting on something that needs **fixed**...
   1. Make sure you have tried to recreate the issue at least once. Transient issues are often the most difficult to track down so please try to ensure the issue can be recreated reliably.
   1. Add screenshots if at all possible and any additional notes about how to recreate the issue.
